# Aptitude-Assessment
A basic comprehension assessment to accompany the orientation materials.

There are many ways that this could be done. The simplest solution may be the best. Ideally this would be a self-contained solution for people to voluntarily test their comprehension of the orientation materials. Automated to add individuals who manage to complete the assessment to a list that will indicate a readiness to begin communicating these ideas accurately and with confidence.
